    * application.yml file will be the default profile and the application-test.yml will be considered a "test" profile.
    * the application-test.yml will be considered a "test" profile.
    * As a pattern, Spring understands the profile name as the value that appears after "-" on the file name
    * If run tests without setting the profile, it will run and use the default values set on the application.yml file
    * To set a profile different from the default we need to pass it as an environment variable, for example
    * SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=test ./gradlew test
